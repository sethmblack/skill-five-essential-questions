# Five Essential Questions

Conduct an organizational self-assessment using Drucker's five questions that every organization must answer to achieve clarity and focus.

---

## When to Use

- Founding or re-founding an organization
- Annual strategic planning
- Organization feels adrift or unfocused
- New leadership wants to understand and align the organization
- User asks "What's our mission?" or "How do we get organizational clarity?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| organization | Yes | The organization being assessed |
| context | Yes | Current situation and what prompted the assessment |
| existing_answers | No | Current mission statement, customer definition, etc. |
| observations | No | Relevant data about results, customer feedback, etc. |

---

## Drucker's Five Questions

For Drucker, these questions are simple but transformative when answered honestly and applied consistently. They were originally developed for nonprofits but apply universally.

### Question 1: What Is Our Mission?

The mission defines why the organization exists. It is:
- Short and sharply focused—should fit on a T-shirt
- About making a difference in people's lives
- Never subordinated to money or convenience
- A reflection of opportunities, competence, and commitment

**The test:** Can every person in the organization state the mission clearly?

### Question 2: Who Is Our Customer?

The customer is the person whose life is changed through your work.

**Primary customer:** Those who directly benefit from your products or services
**Secondary customers:** Those who must be satisfied for you to deliver (partners, stakeholders, supporters)

**The test:** Do you know exactly whose life changes through your work?

### Question 3: What Does the Customer Value?

This is the most important question—and the one most often answered incorrectly.

**Key principle:** Never assume. Never guess. Go to customers systematically and ask.

What customers value is often different from what we think they should value or what we wish they valued. Value changes over time.

**The test:** Have you recently asked customers what they value?

### Question 4: What Are Our Results?

Results are the measurable outcomes that justify the organization's existence.

**Quantitative results:** Numbers, metrics, measurable outcomes
**Qualitative results:** Changes in condition, behavior, competence, hope

**The test:** Can you state specific results you're achieving?

### Question 5: What Is Our Plan?

The plan converts answers to the first four questions into action.

**Five elements of effective plans:**
1. **Abandonment:** What should we stop doing?
2. **Concentration:** What should we focus on?
3. **Innovation:** What new things should we try?
4. **Risk-taking:** What uncertainties are we willing to accept?
5. **Analysis:** How will we know if it's working?

**The test:** What must we do TODAY to achieve results TOMORROW?

## Assessment Guide

For each question:
- **Current answer:** What we say now
- **True answer:** What's actually true
- **Gap:** The distance between stated and actual
- **Implication:** What we should do about the gap

## Constraints

- Honest answers are more valuable than comfortable ones
- Mission should not be subordinated to funding or convenience
- Customer value must be discovered, not assumed
- Results must be specific and measurable
- Plans must "degenerate into work" — a plan that doesn't specify action isn't a plan

## Example

**Input:** "We're a nonprofit coding bootcamp that's been operating for 5 years. We're wondering if we've drifted from our original purpose. Enrollment is down and funders are asking harder questions."

**Output:**

## Five Essential Questions Assessment

### Organization
Nonprofit coding bootcamp, 5 years in operation

### Context
Declining enrollment and increased funder scrutiny suggest mission drift or market change. Leadership seeking clarity on purpose and direction.

---

## Question 1: What Is Our Mission?

### Current Stated Mission
[Assuming typical bootcamp mission]: "To provide underserved communities with the skills needed for careers in technology"

### Assessment
**Clarity:** Partial — "underserved communities" is broad; "skills" and "careers" are vague
**Focus:** Diffuse — Could mean many things
**Relevance:** Questionable — Tech hiring market has changed dramatically in 5 years
**Commitment:** Unknown — Need to see resource allocation

### True Mission (Based on Observation)
Based on declining enrollment and funder questions, the true mission may have drifted to:
- Sustaining the organization itself
- Serving whoever will pay tuition
- Meeting funder reporting requirements

This is common nonprofit drift: mission becomes institutional survival.

### Gap Analysis
If the stated mission is about changing lives in underserved communities, but enrollment is down and funders are questioning, either:
1. The market changed (fewer people need this)
2. The offering no longer matches customer value
3. The mission has quietly shifted

### Recommended Mission Revision
Consider: "We help [specific population] launch software development careers through [specific approach]"

The mission should be testable: Are people from that population actually launching careers?

---

## Question 2: Who Is Our Customer?

### Primary Customer
**Stated:** "Underserved communities" (too broad)
**Actual:** Whoever enrolls — likely a mix of:
- Career changers seeking higher income
- Recent graduates struggling with job market
- Underemployed people seeking skills

### Secondary Customers
| Customer | Role | How We Serve Them |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Funders | Provide resources | Reporting, impact stories |
| Employers | Hire graduates | Job-ready talent pipeline |
| Referral partners | Send students | Credible program |

### Customer Clarity Assessment
- Do we agree internally on who the customer is? Likely No
- Do we prioritize primary customer clearly? Unclear
- Do secondary customers distort our focus? Likely Yes — funder requirements may drive curriculum

### Recommendation
Define the primary customer with specificity:
- Who specifically?
- What's their starting point?
- What outcome do they need?

"Adults without four-year degrees seeking their first job in software development" is clearer than "underserved communities."

---

## Question 3: What Does the Customer Value?

### What We Think They Value
- Coding skills
- Career preparation
- Community and support
- Affordable education

### Evidence of What They Actually Value
| Value | Evidence | Confidence |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Job placement | Students ask about employment rates | High |
| Time to employment | Shorter programs may be winning | Medium |
| Credential recognition | Employer acceptance uncertain | Low |
| ROI | Tuition vs. expected salary increase | Medium |

### Gaps Between Assumption and Reality
- We may overvalue the learning experience; students value the job
- We may assume community matters; students may want efficiency
- Market has more options now; our unique value is less clear

### Voice of Customer
- When did we last systematically ask? Likely not recently
- Method used: Probably assumption based on founding vision

### Recommendation
1. Survey current students: Why did you choose us? What do you need most?
2. Interview graduates: What actually helped you get a job?
3. Research non-enrollees: Why didn't you choose us?

The drop in enrollment is customer voice—they're choosing something else. Understand why.

## Question 4: What Are Our Results?

### Quantitative Results
| Metric | Target | Actual | Assessment |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Enrollment | ? | Declining | Behind |
| Graduation rate | ? | Unknown | Need data |
| Job placement rate | ? | Unknown | Critical metric |
| Salary increase | ? | Unknown | Critical metric |
| Time to employment | ? | Unknown | Need data |

### Qualitative Results
- Are graduates actually working in tech? Unknown or underreported
- Has their economic situation improved? Need longitudinal data
- Are they building careers, not just getting first jobs? Unknown

### Results Clarity Assessment
- Are results clearly defined? Likely No
- Are results measured consistently? Probably inconsistent
- Do results connect to mission? If mission is about careers, must track careers

### Missing Results
The critical results for a bootcamp should be:
1. % of graduates employed in software within 6 months
2. Average salary / salary increase
3. 2-year career trajectory of graduates

If you can't answer these, you can't demonstrate mission fulfillment.

### Recommendation
Implement outcome tracking:
- 6-month post-graduation employment survey
- Salary data (self-reported is fine)
- 2-year check-in for career progression

Without results data, you're flying blind and can't answer funder questions.

---

## Question 5: What Is Our Plan?

### Current Plan Assessment

**Abandonment:**
- What have we decided to stop doing? Unknown — likely nothing (common in struggling orgs)
- What should we stop doing? Activities that don't lead to job placement

**Concentration:**
- What are we focusing on? Probably many things
- Is focus clear and limited? Likely not if enrollment is dropping

**Innovation:**
- What new things are we trying? Unknown
- Are we making room for innovation? Hard to innovate when in survival mode

**Risk-taking:**
- What uncertainties have we accepted? Need to identify
- Are we taking appropriate risks? Declining enrollment suggests insufficient adaptation

**Analysis:**
- How will we know if the plan is working? Currently know via enrollment (lagging indicator)
- When will we reassess? Should be quarterly given situation

### Plan Coherence
Cannot assess without seeing actual plan, but symptoms suggest plan is reactive rather than strategic.

### Recommendation
1. Accept that the market has changed — 5 years ago had different competitors and hiring landscape
2. Decide: What specific job placement outcome do we commit to?
3. Work backward: What must our program deliver to achieve that outcome?
4. Abandon activities that don't contribute to that outcome
5. Test new approaches quickly

---

## Summary: Organizational Clarity Score

| Question | Clarity Level | Priority |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Mission | Partial | Medium |
| Customer | Unclear | **High** |
| Value | Unclear | **High** |
| Results | Unclear | **High** |
| Plan | Unclear | High |

### Key Findings

1. **Customer value has likely shifted** — 5 years of market change; you may be offering what people wanted in 2020, not 2025

2. **Results are not being tracked** — If you can't report job placement and salary outcomes, you can't demonstrate value to funders or students

3. **The drop in enrollment IS customer feedback** — They're voting with their feet. Have you asked them why?

4. **Mission may have drifted to survival** — Common when metrics are unclear; organization sustains itself rather than serving customer

5. **Funders are a leading indicator** — Their questions likely reflect broader market doubts

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediately:** Survey recent graduates on employment outcomes; this is your most important data
2. **Within 30 days:** Define primary customer with specificity and commit to measurable outcomes for that customer
3. **Within 60 days:** Revise program to focus ruthlessly on job placement; abandon everything else
4. **Ongoing:** Track and publish outcomes; transparency builds trust with students and funders

### The Drucker Reminder

"The danger is in acting on what you believe satisfies the customer. You will inevitably make wrong assumptions."

You founded this bootcamp with beliefs about what underserved communities need. After five years, those beliefs may be outdated. The decline in enrollment is not a problem to solve—it is information to learn from. Your customers are telling you something. The question is whether you're willing to listen.
